- **Project objective:** 

   tliQ Hardware, a major player in the hardware industry, is looking to boost sales and improve profit margins.

To tackle this challenge, I’ve rolled up my sleeves and dived into a massive dataset—over half a million sales records—to uncover valuable insights. These insights will empower AtliQ Hardware to make smarter decisions and focus on key metrics that drive their success, such as sales volume and profitability.

Here’s what I’ve done:

✅ I conducted comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to organize and clean the sales data.

✅ I created detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) reports for various product categories.

✅ Additionally, I generated reports on customer net sales and compared market performance against targets. I also established data model relationships and utilized DAX to calculate relevant metrics.

This work sets the stage for AtliQ to make informed decisions and enhance their overall performance.
